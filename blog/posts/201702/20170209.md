summary: The Uses of 'in' vs 'hasOwnProperty'
-->
Last issue I briefly mentioned JavaScript's in operator, but didn't go into much detail about its use. That's the subject we'll be tackling first today.

The in operator will tell you whether an object (or array) has a property name which matches a given string.

```javascript
var fantasyLit = {
    tolkien: "The Lord of the Rings",
    lewis: "The Chronicles of Narnia"
};

// Outputs: true
console.log("tolkien" in fantasyLit);

// Outputs: false
console.log("asimov" in fantasyLit);
```
Looks simple enough, right? But consider this:

```javascript
// Outputs: true
console.log("constructor" in fantasyLit);
```

What's going on here? It turns out that the in operator doesn't distinguish between properties created specifically on an object and properties that the object inherited from the prototype chain. In this case in is seeing the constructor property of Object.prototype which all objects inherit from.

It will also return true for user-defined prototype properties. For instance:

```javascript
function litList () {}

litList.prototype.addToList = function (author, work) {
        this[author] = work;
};

var fantasyLit = new litList();

fantasyLit.addToList("tolkien", "The Lord of the Rings");

// Outputs: true
console.log("tolkien" in fantasyLit);

// Outputs: false
console.log("asimov" in fantasyLit);

// Outputs: true
console.log("addToList" in fantasyLit);
```

Because of this, using in to detect whether an object possesses a given property can be a bit deceptive. Usually we only want to check for properties that belong to the object itself, not its prototype chain. Fortunately, JavaScript has a solution for that. It is called hasOwnProperty.

It is a method on Object.prototype, which means it is available to all JavaScript objects.

Here is how you use it:

```javascript
function litList () {}

litList.prototype.addToList = function (author, work) {
        this[author] = work;
};

var fantasyLit = new litList();

fantasyLit.addToList("tolkien", "The Lord of the Rings");

// Outputs: true
console.log(fantasyLit.hasOwnProperty("tolkien"));

// Outputs: false
console.log(fantasyLit.hasOwnProperty("asimov"));

// Outputs: false
console.log(fantasyLit.hasOwnProperty("addToList"));
```

Because in JavaScript arrays also inherit from Object, they can use hasOwnProperty as well, though it is often less useful.

```javascript
var summerMovies = [
"Iron Man 3",
    "Star Trek: Into Darkness",
    "Man of Steel"
];

// Outputs: true
summerMovies.hasOwnProperty("2");
```

It's important to keep in mind the limits of both in and hasOwnProperty. While they can tell you that a given property has been declared, they can't tell you whether the property has a "real value".

Consider these examples:

```javascript
// Puts a "declared" property on the global object
// (window in browsers)
var declared;

// Outputs: true
console.log("declared" in window);

// Outputs: true
console.log(window.hasOwnProperty("declared"));

// Outputs: undefined
console.log(declared);

var obj = { myUndefined: undefined };

// Outputs: true
console.log("myUndefined" in obj);

// Outputs: true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("myUndefined"));

// Outputs: undefined
console.log(obj.myUndefined);
```

Another limit that you may encounter is that the hasOwnProperty method can be rendered useless if an object happens to define a property named hasOwnProperty. For instance:

```javascript
var voldemort = {
        hasOwnProperty: function () { return true; }
};

// Outputs: true
console.log(voldemort.hasOwnProperty("ridikulus"));
```

Because voldemort defines its own hasOwnProperty, the call never makes it to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty. It's unlikely that you'll run into an object as maliciously constructed as voldemort, but it's good to be aware of the possibility. Here is the workaround:

```javascript
// Returns false
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(voldemort, "ridikulus");
```

Finally, depending on the JavaScript engine, you may have trouble detecting the special __proto__ property with either of these methods.

That's a brief introduction to the use of in and hasOwnProperty.
